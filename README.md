The teacher will be using drawing as a method for elementary school children in a virtual setting  and according to quizzes batches will be made so that it can be tailored for each group of children according to their learning progress. Additionally there will be a side by side chatting platform from where students can communicate  with their teacher as well as their peers and this would keep kids engaged and would enhance their learning capability.
I am going with the Adaptive learning for Basic education because children are the liabilities that could turn into good assets to the country if they are nurtured well and education plays an important role in it my  Doodle it Project would help kids from low income family to get access to basic education but also would help them make friends across globe that would also help them to develop their social skills .

 AI can be used for several purposes:
1. Personalized Learning Paths: AI algorithms can analyze students' performance, preferences, and learning styles to create personalized learning paths tailored to each child's individual needs and abilities.

2. Adaptive Quizzes: AI can generate adaptive quizzes that adjust difficulty based on the child's performance,    providing a customized learning experience and helping identify areas for improvement.

3. Video Recommendations: AI can recommend
